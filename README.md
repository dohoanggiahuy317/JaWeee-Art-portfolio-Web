# Website-JaWeee-art-gallery-web

## Description

This is the website for showing pictures I took when travling around Vietnam. I got this idea when I went out with my Singapore friend and introduced him some famous location in Hanoi. 
I use basic HTML, CSS, and JS with external libraries such as TweenMax and ScrollMagic. Link to my web: https://jaweee-art-gallery.netlify.app/
